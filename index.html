    <h1><i>About me</i></h1>
    <p>
      I’m an aspiring back-end programmer. I first got into programming back in high school with little
      to no idea how to make anything work. That curiosity—wanting to understand how things work and
      what makes our society run the way it does today—is what pulled me into coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through years of learning, making mistakes, and improving, I’ve built a foundation in problem-solving,
      persistence, and continuous learning. I hope this portfolio shows what I can do and what I’m working toward,
      and I’m always open to feedback.
    </p>

      <h2><b>Military (Air Force)</b></h2>
      <h3>Sep 2020 – <span class="w3-tag w3-teal w3-round">Current</span></h3>
      <p>
        My time in the Air Force has strengthened my discipline, attention to detail, and ability to learn
        complex systems quickly. Working in a structured, high-responsibility environment has taught me how
        to stay calm under pressure, collaborate with diverse teams, and follow procedures carefully—skills
        that translate directly into writing reliable, maintainable code.

    <div id="Grubhub">
      <h2><b>Grubhub</b></h2>
      <h3>Jul 2019 – Sep 2021</h3>
      <p>
        I worked as a delivery driver using the Grubhub app to pick up and deliver food orders. Over time,
        I learned how to carefully review order details, double-check everything before delivery, and manage
        my time efficiently while navigating different routes. It also helped me practice clear communication
        with customers and restaurants.

    <div id="Doordash">
      <h2><b>DoorDash</b></h2>
      <h3>Aug 2018 – Jul 2019</h3>
      <p>
        As a DoorDash delivery driver, I handled customer orders through the app and delivered them accurately
        and on time. This role taught me to pay close attention to instructions, manage multiple deliveries at once,
        and double-check everything before completing an order. It reinforced responsibility, reliability, and
        professionalism when interacting with customers.
      </p>

    <div id="Rite Aid">
      <h2><b>Rite Aid</b></h2>
      <h3>Feb 2017 – Dec 2017</h3>
      <p>
        I worked as a cashier at Rite Aid, assisting customers and handling transactions. I interacted with many
        different people every day, which taught me patience, active listening, and how to engage with customers
        in a friendly and professional way. That experience helped build my confidence in communication—something
        that’s just as important in tech as it is in retail.
