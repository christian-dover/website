      <h2 id="C++"><u><b>C++</u></b></h2>
      <p>The C++ Language i learned in school and the first language that i was taught, it was challanging to me
        becuase of all the rules and syntax you had to learn for this language. it did help me get my feet wet
        when it came to programming and showed me all the things you can do with programming and what it has been used
        for in our society.

      <h3>Calendar Project</h3>
      <p>this project coding future dates from the starting date given from the user. what i leanred from this was
        that programming doesnt always have a simple answer to everything, and you will have get more creative with your
        work in order
        to make the program isself work in a logical way.

        <h3>Area Project</h3>
        <p>for this project i wanted to see if i could create something that could calculate an area for a rectangle.
          what this project showed me is how to get user input, and use the input in the formula that calculates the
          area
          for the rectangle and the perimter for it.

        <p>this project was one of my first project i did which was just getting the birthday

          mishaps they made such as wrong day or month. what i learned in this project is that
          putting things toogether there are going to be a lot of things to account for which
          can slow down you program.in which you will have simplify your program down in order to

      <h3>large volume manager(lvm)</h3>
      <p>when i started working with linux i noticed that most of linux is used for servers and how they deal with all
